            <h2>How Alcohol Affects You Right Away</h2>
            <p>Alcohol affects the central nervous system almost instantly after consumption. Even small amounts can lead to lowered inhibitions, impaired coordination, and slowed reaction times. As more alcohol is consumed, these effects become more pronounced, often leading to slurred speech, blurred vision, and poor decision-making. In large quantities, alcohol can cause blackouts, vomiting, and even unconsciousness.</p>

            <h2>Health Problems from Drinking Too Much</h2>
            <p>Regular heavy drinking can lead to serious long-term health problems. The liver is especially vulnerable, with conditions like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, and cirrhosis developing over time. Alcohol also increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and certain cancers. The brain can suffer as well, with chronic use leading to memory problems, mood disorders, and cognitive decline.</p>

            <h2>Alcohol and Your Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Alcohol doesn’t just affect the body—it also has a strong impact on mental health and social well-being. People who drink heavily are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other emotional issues. Over time, alcohol abuse can damage personal relationships, create tension in families, and lead to isolation. It can also negatively affect work and academic performance, leading to a cycle of stress and further drinking.</p>

            <h2>Dangers and Safety Risks</h2>
            <p>Beyond the health effects, alcohol use comes with serious safety risks. Drunk driving is one of the leading causes of traffic-related deaths and injuries. Alcohol is also a factor in many accidents, falls, and violent incidents. Mixing alcohol with other drugs or medications can be extremely dangerous, and binge drinking significantly increases the risk of overdose or alcohol poisoning.</p>
