            <h2>How Alcohol Affects You Right Away</h2>
            <p>Alcohol affects the central nervous system almost instantly after consumption. Even small amounts can lead to lowered inhibitions, impaired coordination, and slowed reaction times. As more alcohol is consumed, these effects become more pronounced, often leading to slurred speech, blurred vision, and poor decision-making. In large quantities, alcohol can cause blackouts, vomiting, and even unconsciousness.</p>
